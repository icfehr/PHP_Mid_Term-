Files added to Github, Commandline continues to be annoying. Github Desktop App is much easier to work with...

Code seems done, need to deploy. -- Figure out how to deploy on replit

Computer based servers continue to be a pain to deal with on windows and linux is as bit to much of a drastic jump for how custom my computer setup is. 

Being unable to deploy at all has made this whole project entirely more difficult than it needs to be, I dont understand why no one has just come up with a small dev enviroment that works natively? It seems like it would fix more than a few issues especially since PHP is literally the back end of the entire internet at this point. 

AI variable checking has and continues to be the greatest thing ever invented for making sure variables are conistant and my stupid self just doesnt add and s randomly on a variable. Saves me so much time bug hunting for syntax errors.

Deployment is a pain, ive gone through 3 different platforms including the base server installed on my computer. 

Replit auto complete is nice but really inaccurate for variables 

Databases are a pain, at this point im sure that im going to have to create a database from scratch.... so that will be a fun 5 hours
